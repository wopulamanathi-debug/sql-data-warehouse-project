/*
DDL script: Craete Gold Layer Views
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
===============================================================================
    This script creates views for the Gold layer in the data warehouse. 
    The Gold layer represents the final dimension and fact tables (Star Schema)

    Each view performs transformations and combines data from the Silver layer 
    to produce a clean, enriched, and business-ready dataset.

/* CREATE gold_dim_customer VIEW
=====================================================================================
-->>Left joined all the tables that contain customer information so as to put them in one dimension table, that provides all the description of a customer.

-->> Perfoming data integration to help take care of the unmatching gende table, and integrate two source systems in one.
-->> The data in the crm for genders is more accurate than the data in erp,
-->> This means if the data from the Silver.erp_cust_az12 does not match the data in the silver.crm_cust_info
-->> The silver.crm_cust_info gender should be taken.
-->> If there are nulls/ n/a then take the gender from the column that has a value.

-->> Renamed the columns in the table to friendly names so that they can be easily reused by the users.
-->> Create surrogate keys for this dimension table using windows functions.
